## Hey There!

I am Subham Roy. I am an Electronics Engineer by education. I am currently working as a full-time intern at STMicroelectronics, India. I find all kinds of machines interesting but computers are by far the love of my life. 

This blog is an attempt to improve my writing skills and to express myself better through a pen (or a keyboard, in this case).

In this blog, I will either,
- teach about something that I learned
- or, learn about something, by teaching it.

### Writing

To say the least about my writing, I am fine for a few paragraphs, but after that I start spewing a malformed mixture of sentences and words that look nothing short of a genetic experiment gone wrong. I might have exaggerated a little there, but you'll get the idea. Basically, I am not good with forming structure with my words.

So, the motive is to write about various things that I find interesting and if you, the reader, find my writing interesting or boring or shit, please provide some critical comments on which I can build up.


### My other love

Since childhood, I was quite fond of music. I started learning to play a couple of instruments, I tried singing, but it turned out, my adolescent mind was not interested in those. It was not until I heard Jimi Hendrix' 'All Along the Watchtower' that I was fascinated by his style of playing the guitar. 
Since then, I have followed genres like rock, blues and metal. 

So, I started teaching myself guitar. I played the guitar because it gave me sense of accomplishment when I perfected, say a solo or a lick. It is addictive, but in a good way.
